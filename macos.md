Just like the iOS version, there's a few projects that are exclusive for SwiftUI, and much more that use UIKit. I've started with SwiftUI, and will skip the same ones on the UIKit version.

## Project #1: Cows and Bulls
A simple game that uses a list and input, with a very simple game logic.

[repo]()

### 1- Techniques:

- SwiftUI
- List
- Input
- window.title

### 2- Step-by-step:

Created a list, an input form, organized the UI, and did a few methods that make the game work.

### 3- Challenges:

The tutorial still used SwiftUI 1, which uses AppDelegate, so had to Google the updated solution, which is actually simpler. Added an animation when we add an input. Added onCommit to the textfield, so users can input pressing Enter. Also added some app info in the touchBar.
