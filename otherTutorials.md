### 1- Techniques:
- Extending URLSession with Combine to decode a JSON payload
- get and post method to extend URLSession to communicate externally
- Extending Bundle to decode and encode a generic type
- Generic Type
- CoreData

### 2- Step-by-step:
We created SwiftUI views to show data that would come from the web, detail it, and organized it.
Then we created codable Models from JSON files, presented them, with the bundle extension.
Then we used the URLSession extension to get this data from the API and show it in our app, then post it into another web server, provided by TwoStraws.
We used a simple CoreData model to store favorites in memory.
