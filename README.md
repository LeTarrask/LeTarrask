### Hi there 👋 I'm Alex

Transitioning from an ad copywriting background, I ventured into the realm of coding. Beginning with Python programming classes, I concurrently pursued a Master's Degree in Game Design and Development. My journey led me to self-educate in Swift, primarily through resources like Paul Hudson's books and website.

Presently, I'm dedicated to honing my Swift skills and enhancing user interfaces across several SwiftUI projects. Eager to contribute to open-source initiatives, my interests lie in creativity, storytelling, games, marketing and all facets of communication.

### Log: - Here's the stuff I'm working right nowadays

* **Placeholder Project** - After working on an MVP that uses the iOS Camera API as a proof of concept, I'm rewriting the application from the ground up, leading to the release of version 1.0. Part of it includes the open sourced fork of [Aespa](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Aespa), and an iOS client that uses Core Data and a Firebase server.

### Portfolio: - Those are the projects I'm most proud of

Following the advice of learning by doing, I've created a few projects that are usable. I'm using a few of those personally, and a few are distributed in the App Store.

* [**Mileage Tracker**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Mileage-Tracker) - A SwiftUI logger to calculate average fuel consumption for my bike. [Available in the iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/fuel-logue/id1670711112). Currently with a 1.1 version with improved design by Cristina Santos, and working on a version with more animations.

* [**Kawaiible**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dobble) - Digital version of the Dobble Card Game for kids. [Available in the iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/kawaiibble/id1670616622).

* [**Dungeon Dwellers 5e**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dungeon_Dwellers) - Final project to complete Harvard CS50x, this app is a catalogue of open source RPG creatures, loaded from an external source, and stored in Core Data, along with user data. It uses a MVVM architecture, and adapts to different devices and display sizes.

* [**2048**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/2048) - A pure SwiftUI version of the 2048 game. A nice weekend project to prove myself that I can do interesting stuff within an advertising agency deadline.

* [**Cold Turkey**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/ColdTurkey) - A little project app that holds a password secret for some time. I did this project to fight procrastination through social media abuse. :)

* [**Tobem Ipsum**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Tobem-Ipsum) - A Loren Ipsum generator created in a 2 day hackaton as a Status Bar app for Mac OS.

* [**Dreadline**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dreadline) - A text editor to avoid procrastination. It sends your texts to your PM/Boss/Coworker/other responsible person when the time is over.

* [**Remember that night**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Remember_that_night) - A Flask interface for a Python script that generate playlists for fake festivals on Spotify.
