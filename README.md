### Hi there 👋 I'm Alex

I'm an ad copywriter that decided to write code. I've had some programming classes in Python, and then started learning Swift by myself, mostly with [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws)'s books and site.

Currently I’m working on my Swift skills and improving the UI in a few SwiftUI projects. 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, with marketing and anything communications & advertising related.

### Log: - Here's the stuff I'm working right now
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create nice interfaces using SwiftUI. So I'm getting a few small apps and tweaking their interfaces.
* [**Pomodoro**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Pomodoro) - Created the logic for a Pomodoro app, now need to polish the UI.

* [**Dualogue**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dualogue) - A conversation talk list in SwiftUI. My personal approach to a to do list, that also uses CNContacts and Core Data. Coding it has taught me a lot, but the usefulness of the app is not that great.


### Portfolio: - Those are the projects I'm most proud of
Following the advice of learning by doing, I've created a few projects that are usable.

* [**2048**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/2048) - A pure SwiftUI version of the 2048 game. A nice weekend project to prove myself that I can do interesting stuff with an advertising agency deadline.

* [**Dreadline**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dreadline) - A text editor to avoid procrastination. It sends your texts to your PM/Boss/Coworker/other responsible person when the time is over.

* [**Remember that night**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Remember_that_night) - A Flask interface for a Python script that generate playlists for fake festivals on Spotify.

* [**Iniciativer**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Iniciativer) - First SwiftUI project, a simple iniciative tracker for TTRPGs.

* [**1 milhão de folhas**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/1-milh-o-de-folhas) - My first app store launch, an art project for random poetry.


### Other: - Politics/memes/luz
Some small projects I've done for fun.

* [**VaiaTemer**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/VaiaTemer) - A twitterbot to boo a former president.

* [**Mecanismator**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Mecanismator) - A Chrome plugin in javascript to replace real names with characters from Netflix's The Mechanism.

* [**Odebrechtr**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Odebretchr) - A Chrome plugin in javascript to replace Brazilian politician names with their codenames in a bribery scandal.
