### Hi there 👋 I'm Alex

I'm an ad copywriter that decided to write code. I've started with programming classes in Python while I got a Master Degree in Gamedesign and Development, and then started learning Swift by myself, mostly with [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws)'s books and site.

Currently I’m working on my Swift skills and improving the UI in a few SwiftUI projects. I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, with marketing and anything communications & advertising related.

### Log: - Here's the stuff I'm working right nowadays

* [**Placeholder Project**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/CameraTest) - I've spent a couple of months working on an MVP that uses the iOS Camera API as a proof of concept for a project.

* [**TimeZoner**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/TimeZoner) - a personal project to display different working timezones to help me visualize and collaborate with teammates around the world.

### Portfolio: - Those are the projects I'm most proud of

Following the advice of learning by doing, I've created a few projects that are usable. I'm using a few of those personally, and a few are distributed in the App Store.

* [**Mileage Tracker**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Mileage-Tracker) - A SwiftUI logger to calculate average fuel consumption for my bike. [Available in the iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/fuel-logue/id1670711112).

* [**Kawaiible**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dobble) - Digital version of the Dobble Card Game for kids. [Available in the iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/kawaiibble/id1670616622).

* [**2048**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/2048) - A pure SwiftUI version of the 2048 game. A nice weekend project to prove myself that I can do interesting stuff with an advertising agency deadline.

* [**Cold Turkey**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/ColdTurkey) - A little project app that holds a password secret for some time. I did this project to fight procrastination through social media abuse. :)

* [**Tobem Ipsum**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Tobem-Ipsum) - A Loren Ipsum generator created in a 2 day hackaton as a Status Bar app for Mac OS.

* [**Dreadline**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Dreadline) - A text editor to avoid procrastination. It sends your texts to your PM/Boss/Coworker/other responsible person when the time is over.

* [**Remember that night**](https://github.com/LeTarrask/Remember_that_night) - A Flask interface for a Python script that generate playlists for fake festivals on Spotify.
