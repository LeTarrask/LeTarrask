## Project #1: Happy Days
A memory recording project that uses AVAudio and ImagePicker for UIKit, but I'm doing it for SwiftUI for a better challenge

[repo]()

### 1- Techniques:

- SwiftUI
- Permissions
- Image Picker (actually reused some code from an older project)
- AVFoundation

### 2- Step-by-step:

Started trying to do UIKit, but then found it was too much of a hassle to redraw screen and navigation, so I decided to just copy the functionality for SwiftUI. Added image picker, created a sheet to ask for Permissions. Added an ObservableObject to be the storage-controller. Interrupted development due to some weird XCode bug.

### 3- Challenges:
