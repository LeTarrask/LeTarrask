### Project #11: Pachinko
Dive into SpriteKit to try your hand at fast 2D games.
(repo)[]

## 1-  Techniques:
**Sprite Kit**
- SpriteKit
- Reseting the project
- didMove (equivalent of ViewDidLoad pra GameKit)
- addChild (para adicionar objetos à cena)
- physicsBody
- physicsWorld.contactDelegate
- SKLabelNode (tipo um label)
- touchesBegan (pra interpretar os toques na tela)
- physicsBody?.isDinamic (to make the physicsBody respond to contacts and touches and etc)
- SKEmitterNode (to use particles)
- Particles editor

## 2- Step-by-step:
Created a Pachinko app. It creates a ball that falls into different holes, and if they're right, it adds points. The game is quite boring, but shows how the game features work.

## 3- Challenges:
First was to choose different colors randomly when the ball is created. Just created an array that holds all the filenames and picks a randomElement(); Second was to add an if to change ball drop location to be always over 640 points; Third was more complex: contact has to destroy the box barriers, had to add a name to them and then, when they're contacted, they're destroyed.
