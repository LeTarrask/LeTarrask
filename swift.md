# Swift Learning Path

My idea is to speed run through these projects, assessing what I already know, building super fast whatever it is, and also writing down what I don't know. For the tenth time, instead of doing it in three months, I'll do it in one.

All the HackingWithSwift projects will be stored in one single repo.

My projects have their respective repos.
